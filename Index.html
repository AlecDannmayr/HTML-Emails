                        <p>At its most basic level, email marketing is the use of email to promote your business. It is used to cultivate relationships with potential customers, keep current customers informed and updated on your brand, offer coupons to encourage customer loyalty, and more!</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading-1">Why Email Marketing?</h3>
                        <p>It is a direct form of marketing, similar to marketing through snail mail, but email marketing is much more efficient for your wallet and for the environment since it is totally paperless!</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading-2">Is It Worth It?</h3>
                        <p>Some people think email marketing is outdated, but they could not be more wrong. Email marketing has been utilized since shortly after the birth of the Internet. It has evolved considerably since then and is still an incredibly useful marketing tool. In fact, many entrepreneurs argue that email marketing is more important now than ever before. There is a good reason 85% of U.S. retailers consider email marketing one of the most effective customer acquisition tactics!</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading-3">Will it help to retain Customers?</h3>
                        <p>Email marketing can be used to build trust with customers over time to turn them into repeat customers. It is also an effective way to keep your customers informed about new sales or promotions you are running. People want to stay informed about your brand, and email marketing is one of the best ways to stay engaged with that audience. In fact, 28% of US online shoppers report subscribing to store or product emails in order to stay informed on brands they care about.</p>

                                <p>
                                Anytime a business operates, they need email. Yes, there's Slack, there's Skype, and many other channels, but businesses still revolve around email, and if businesses still use it, you can bet that if you get an email in their inbox and they read it, you can generate sales. For that reason, emails aren't going away. Gmail ads are growing in revenue, more and more people every single quarter are leveraging Gmail ads just because they know emails are powerful. <br> 
                                So the first part of your question is, are emails valuable, yes. I know that's not directly what you answered, but the second part, which I'll get to is, do they still work, yes, because people still read emails.

                                 <p>Like most marketers, you’ve probably got a lot of things to do and not enough time and resources to do them. Because of this, the key to your success is focusing on the strategies and tactics that drive results and not spending too much time on those that don’t. By measuring the performance of your email marketing, you can see how it compares to other channels (like social media, PPC, content syndication) and better prioritize your time and efforts to drive maximum results. <br>
